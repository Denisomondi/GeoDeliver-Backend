This repository contains a Sinatra application that serves as a backend server for handling API requests and managing various resources. The application utilizes controllers to handle different routes and performs CRUD operations on users, orders, order items, and products.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Ruby
- Bundler (Ruby Gem Manager)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sinatra application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running the command `bundle install`.
4. Start the server with `ruby app.rb`.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:4567` to see the application.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `app/controllers`: Contains the controllers for managing different resources.
- `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`: Handles routes and operations related to users.
